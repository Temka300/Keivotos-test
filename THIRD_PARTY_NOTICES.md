# Third-party notices

Keivotos source code is licensed under Apache-2.0. It depends on open-source
Python and JavaScript packages whose copyrights and licenses remain with their
respective authors. The Windows build collects installed runtime license files
into `licenses/`; `package-lock.json` and `uv.lock` record the resolved package
set used by the build.

## Separately invoked tools

The portable folder keeps the following command-line tools separate from
`Keivotos.exe` and invokes them as child processes:

- **gallery-dl 1.32.6** — GPL-2.0-only. Source:
  <https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl>. The portable build includes its license.
- **FFmpeg 7.1 Gyan.dev essentials build** — configured with GPLv3 components.
  Source and build-provider information is included in
  `licenses/FFmpeg-7.1/FFMPEG_SOURCE.md`; `ffmpeg.exe -L` prints the applicable
  license and build configuration.

Do not remove license or source-availability material when redistributing a
portable archive. Dependency licenses can change between versions; inspect the
generated distribution rather than treating this file as legal advice.
