# Keivotos

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Keivotos is a local-first library that indexes the files you already won. Insterad of opening unrelated folders and applications to find your images, videos, music, documents, social-media archives, mangas, animes, and other saved content. Your original fiels remain in their existing folders. Keivotos only indexes them in place and aims to bring them together in one searchable interface.

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Windows | ✅ |
| Linux / macOS | untested, source may run |

## Getting started

### Portable build (Windows)

1. Extract the whole release folder. Don't run the exe from inside the ZIP.
2. Start `Keivotos.exe`.
3. Your browser opens at <http://localhost:52325/>.

If you downloaded a release with a `.sha256` file next to it, you can use it to verify the ZIP.

### From source

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a current Node.js LTS, then:

```powershell
.\run.bat
```

The launcher sets up Python 3.11 from `uv.lock`, builds the frontend if needed, and starts the server. Manual commands and dev mode are in [docs/build/source.md](docs/build/source.md).
